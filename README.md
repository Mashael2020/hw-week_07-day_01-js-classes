# HW JS Classes

Suppose that we wanted to create a simple program ('RunTracker') that helps people prepare for running a 5k. Each day that a person runs, they create a record of their run.

The program stores information about the user 
- the user's name
- the user's email address 

The program stores information about each run

- the date and time of the run
- the distance covered, in meters
- the time taken, in seconds

The program can perform some actions
- add run
- compute total distance run
- compute longest distance run so far 
- compute average speed (speed = totalDist / totalTime)
